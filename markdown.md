Q(1): Hi there! I'm the Harvard SCAS Chatbot, a resource directory of Massachusetts small claims information.<br><br>What can I help you with today?
A: Filing a small claim
	Q(1.1): Have you...
	A: Been wronged and want to sue.
		Q(1.1.1): Is this person/business located in Massachusetts?
		A: Yes.
			Q(1.1.1.1): What would you like to know about the claims process?
			A: How do I get started?
				Q(1.1.1.1.1): First, send a "demand letter" to the person you want to sue–preferably typed. Include a chronology (or account) of what happened. Be as specific as you can, and mention dates, specific contracts, or interactions. Secondly, include the amount of money that the defendant owes you. Lastly, include a statement that informs the reader that "If you do not fulfill this request within 30 days, I intend to sue in small claims court." If the other party does not respond within 30 days, then you should begin the small claims process.
				A: I'd like help drafting this letter.

			A: How much will this cost?
				Q(1.1.1.1.2): If your claim is $500 or less, it costs $40 to file.<br>If your claim is $500.01 to $2,000.00, it costs $50 to file.<br>If your claim is $2,000.01 to $5,000.00, it costs $100 to file.<br>If your claim is $5,000.01 to $7,000.00, it costs $150 to file.<br>You can usually recover this filing fee — there is a field on the small claims filing form for that. However, that decision is up to the clerk magistrate.

			A: Where do I sue?
				Q(1.1.1.1.3): Use the courthouse that serves the city in which you live or work or where the defendant lives or works. It’s recommended that you go to the court where the defendant is located so it is easier to enforce a judgment if you win the case. If you choose a court near yourself, you will have to file a different form in the court near the defendant, and it will cost money to file. 
				A: I'd like more help.

			A: What do I say in court? 
				Q(1.1.1.1.4): While we cannot say whether or not you will win your case, a good guide to what to present to the clerk magistrate is as follows:<br>- A brief overview of the conflict.<br>- A more detailed chronology of what happened. Be sure to be organized, clear, and concise; bring along evidence such as receipts, call records, or pictures that might help your case.<br>- What you’ve already done to try to solve the problem.<br>- What the law says should happen.<br>- A suggestion for how much you are owed.
				A: I'd like more guidance.

			Q(1.1.1.2): The Massachusetts "Long-Arm Statute" allows plaintiffs to sue parties who are out-of-state as long as they do business in Massachusetts, possesses property in Massachusetts, or contracts/supplies services in Massachusetts. If the party profits from business in Massachusetts and their action/lack of action also causes substantial damage in Massachusetts, then they also may be sued.

		Q(1.1.2): The judge should set up a payment hearing (either on the day of the hearing, or at a later date) for the debtor and the creditor to set up a payment agreement.

Q(4): The Small Claims Advisory Service is a part of the Phillips Brooks House Association, a student-run public service organization affiliated with Harvard College.
A: Our history
	Q(4.1): SCAS was founded in 1973 as a subcommittee of the Phillips Brooks House Legal Committee. The first SCAS volunteers worked out of the Roxbury Courthouse, helping clients prepare for their cases by informing them of their rights. Originally, SCAS was no more than six students. Since that time, SCAS has grown considerably. We now have over 100 active volunteers helping the citizens of Massachusetts navigate the small claims system directly by phone and by appointment, and indirectly by advocating structural (i.e. legislative) change.

A: Our mission
	Q(4.2): The Small Claims Advisory Service is the only organization in Massachusetts that focuses primarily on helping individuals navigate the small claims court system in the Commonwealth. Our mission is to empower socioeconomically disadvantaged people in order for them to seek legal redress effectively through the small claims system, and to protect their rights as consumers, tenants, and members of our community. Often, these individuals are unaware of their options without our help. We provide citizens with information on Massachusetts law, small claims procedure, and effective court presentations.
