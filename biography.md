# SCAS Chatbot
Chatbot created for the Harvard Small Claims Advisory Service. This chatbot serves as my final project submission for Suffolk University Law School's Coding the Law course.

# Framing
My partnering client for this project is the Small Claims Advisory Service at Harvard. During my initial meeting with the organization's co-directors, they expressed the difficulty faced by volunteers in maintaining timely responses to email and telephone queries from community members seeking legal resources. The main issue currently facing volunteers is the backlog generated by the contact form, direct emails, and voicemails that pile up over the semester (especially during exam periods), with response times often exceeding seven days. The co-directors were concerned that this lengthy response time was directly affecting both the organization's reputation with community members as well as student volunteer morale.
 
According to SCAS's 2019 community report, 58% of community members had expressed they would use a texting service if offered. For a small, student-led organization with a limited budget, SCAS does not have the financial resources to pay for a text relay service. Recognizing the community's strong interest in instantaneous communication, student volunteers with time constraints, and the organization's financial constraints, I proposed a comparable solution — a chatbot that would triage frequently occuring queries and direct community members to applicable resources, whether it be a basic FAQ response, direction to an informational resource, or a generated message that sent as an email to SCAS’s main inbox that contained the user’s issue and a chatlog for further assistance. 
 
# Research
Substantial review of existing solutions, including relevant technical and content-based solutions (e.g., form banks) and involving consultation with practitioners. Depth and breadth of research greatly exceeds that of other projects.

My first step was to consider the direct interest of the community and investigate free/low-cost text SMS bot platforms; this research did not identify any pre-existing services or creative platforms that would be within the organization's budget .  While my initial Google Voice does have a texting feature it violates Google's "System Interference and Abuse" provision in its [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/googlevoice/program-policies.html). Additionally, as students are not allowed to use their personal numbers to respond to messages from community members, I ruled out text relay services entirely.

After thoroughly ruling out SMS-based solutions, I quickly shifted my research to chatbots, as I believed the bot would help the organization to provide resources to community members swiftly and without creating any unnecessary backlog. I began exploring the use of regular expressions in JavaScript to parse queries based on user input, but ultimately concluded that [QnA Markup](https://www.qnamarkup.org/) would provide a more sustainable language framework for student volunteers to edit.
 
# Ideation & Prototyping
Considers and weighs the costs & benefits of multiple technical solutions or design configurations. Creates prototype only after considering at least three alternatives. These may be the subject of A-B testing below. 


 
# User Testing
Makes use of two or more of the following in close to real-world conditions: A-B testing, multiple testers other than themselves for each type of user, potential real-world user(s). Captures user feedback in a uniform comparable manner. Student provides copy of user feedback. 



# Refinement
User feedback is thoughtfully integrated into the final version of the solution (where the solution includes both the technical product and any documentation). At least two rounds of user testing were conducted with iterative improvements to the solution after each round. Use of multiple tests amount to more than testing for testing's sake.
